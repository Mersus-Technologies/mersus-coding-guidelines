# mersus-coding-guidelines

This document describes the rule and recommendations for developing software application and class libraries in .NET using C# as a language. The main purpose is to define the general guidelines to enforce consistent coding styles and formatting that can be useful for developers to avoid common mistakes they do while development of software applications using C#. This document covers naming conventions, coding styles and some architecture level suggestions.

**This document will serve as the **Mersus Coding Guidelines**, every developer should adhere to these standards and follow the set of rules laid down in these document.**

As our primary language is C# we follow the list of existing guidelines setup by the C# community.

**Purpose:**

Coding standards are a set of guidelines used for programming language that recommends programming style and best practices to achieve it.
 
The coding standards generally covers indentation, comments, naming conventions, programming practices, file structure within project, architectural best practices etc. Software developers are highly recommended to follow these guidelines. The coding guidelines have following advantages.
- Increases the readability of source code written.
- Will contain fewer bugs and work more efficiently.
- Requires less maintenance.
- Easier for old and new developers to maintain and modify the code.
- Leads to increase in productivity of developers.
- Reduces the overall cost for software development.
- Make the difference between a successful project and a project that is, at worst, dead on delivery.
